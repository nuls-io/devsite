NULS Community Profile</strong></h2> <p>NULS is a blockchain infrastructure for customizable services and a global open-source community. The designed technical architecture of NULS consists of a micro-kernel and functional modules. With innovative ideas on reducing the main block chain and decoupling events and services, high modularization on underlying architecture is achieved. The NULS project, following the principles of hot plugging, modularization and parallel expansion, provides smart contracts, multi-chain mechanism and cross-chain consensus to reduce cost of development and use, and to promote the application of blockchain in the commercial field. With the proposal of basic framework containing modular thinking and multi-chain mechanism, NULS upholds the “chain” as its core development philosophy and is striving for building a core product - “Chain Factory” where users can select core function modules as they like to create their own blockchains on the NULS chain network and define their own business logic with little programming, to include smart contracts.</p> <p><strong>NULS community is an organization of a group of people who highly assent to NULS community culture and philosophy and have the same purpose and vision to work for the development of NULS community ecology.</strong> NULS community members include the NULS Foundation, Council members, contributors, the open-source technology community - CODE CRAFT COUNCIL (CCC) and other all NULS Holders.</p> <h2 id="ii-nuls-foundation"><a href="#ii-nuls-foundation" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>II.
