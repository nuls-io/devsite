So, in September 2017, the core team defined the modular architecture, which was designed to make it easier for developers to write, and for users to utilize. NULS 1.0 achieves the modular effect at the coding paradigm level, but this design doesn’t solve the problem of tight coupling between modules. Developers who want to use a module or participate in the development of a module would need to understand the design of other modules associated with it and can only use a specific language for the development of their module.

This new modular architecture enhanced with microservice suites, that have no programming language limitations, is called NULS 2.0. Modules in this architecture enjoy even more decoupling, while the feature of multi-language development greatly improves the contribution of code and the convenience of users.
