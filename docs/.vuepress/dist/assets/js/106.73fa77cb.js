Our Plans")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("Make chain creation easy!\nFirstly, we hope to establish a module repository covering 80% of the underlying blockchain technology.\nBy increasing the number of modules in the repository, we will lower the entry barrier for the blockchain industry. This will result in lower costs for enterprises to launch chains, making it easier for users to use chains. We believe that only in this way can blockchain technology become more integrated into daily life.\nTogether with the technical community, we are building a brand new architecture - NULS 2.0. The new architecture will allow NULS modules to run independently, with low coupling between modules utilizing standard-defined interfaces. At that time, any developer (regardless of programming language) only needs to comply with the NULS module standard to develop functional modules in their preferred language, enriching the module repository.\nSecondly, based on the module repository, NULS will launch a blockchain engine called ChainBox. If developers are clear about the parameters of the blockchain they are developing, such as consensus mechanisms, block size, block time, etc., even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology, they only need a few steps to have their own public chain (of course, consortium chains and private chains are also supported) in a few minutes, greatly shortening the current development time for public chains.\nAll of the above work will involve the participation of the technical community. If you have any opinions or suggestions about our plans, you can propose them in the technical community, showcasing your unique insights.\nThe NULS Technical Community currently has more than 200 developers. We welcome more developers to join us. You will be building the ecosystem together with NULS.")]),e._v(" "),t("h2",{attrs:{id:"v-how-to-join-the-development-team"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#v-how-to-join-the-development-team"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" V.
