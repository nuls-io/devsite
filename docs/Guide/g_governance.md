## Voting Right

After importing the address, users can view the number of votes available to the changed address. 1NULS=1 Vote. Users can set other addresses as proxy addresses, and the proxy uses its own ticket rights. (Enter an address or alias)

 

In addition, the user can also cancel the proxy actively after setting the address of the proxy.

 

If other users set your address as agent, then the user can view them in my agent, and also can cancel the operation to void the voting agent for other users.

The candidates are listed from top to bottom according to the number of votes, in each of three categories that reflect the three types of councilors.

Council members can review or reject the application proposals, (When all the councilors reject the proposal, the proposal cannot enter the voting stage, and it will show a review of the refusals.)
