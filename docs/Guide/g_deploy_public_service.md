# Deploy the mainnet wallet containing public-service

## docker deployment

Compared with ordinary wallets, the advanced wallet has several modules: **public-service**, block browser, and web light wallet.The biggest difference from a regular wallet is that the public-service module will store the chain data redundantly in mongodb (included in the image).The advantage is that it is more convenient to use and does not need to rely on the browser and web light wallet provided by the NULS Foundation.

The operation method is as follows:

```text
        docker run \
        --name nuls-wallet \
        -d \
        -p 8001:8001 \      
        -p 8002:8002 \
        -p 8003:8003 \      
        -p 8005:1999  \
        -p 8004:8004 \
        -p 8006:8006 \
        -v `pwd`/mongo_data:/nuls/mongo_data \
        -v `pwd`/mongo_log:/nuls/mongo_log \
        -v `pwd`/data:/nuls/data \
        -v `pwd`/logs:/nuls/Logs \
        nuls-wallet-pro:v2.0.0

### Starter wallet

Download the compressed package containing the public-service (nuls_wallet_pro.tar.gz) from [GitHub] (https://github.com/nuls-io/nuls-v2/releases), upload it to the server, and start it after decompression (starting Before, the server needs to open ports: 8001, 8002, 8003). After the wallet is started, you can access public-service through (ip:8003), and you can add your own node service in the node service of web wallet and light wallet.
