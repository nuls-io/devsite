# Advanced Description

## I. Smart Contract Fee

### 1. Who pays for the smart contract fee?

When `Create Smart Contracts`, `Call Smart Contracts`, `Delete Smart Contracts`, the handling fee is paid by the address at which the transaction is initiated, and the contract address itself does not pay the handling fee.

### 2. How to charge for smart contract fees, how to charge? How much does the interface caller pay? Who received these fees?

In the main chain, there are three more types of transactions, `Create Smart Contracts`, `Call Smart Contracts`, `Delete Smart Contracts`.

The difference between the three transactions and other transactions such as `transfer" lies in the execution of one smart contract, so the execution of smart contracts is also one of the charging standards. 

* Smart contract charging calculation method

```java
Public static final int COMPARISON = 1;//Compare bytecode
Public static final int CONSTANT = 1;//simple numeric type bytecode
Public static final int LDC = 1; / / numeric constant, string constant (length * LDC)
Public static final int CONTROL = 5;//control bytecode
Public static final int TABLESWITCH = 2; // switch bytecode (size * TABLESWITCH)
Public static final int LOOKUPSWITCH = 2; // switch bytecode (size * LOOKUPSWITCH)
Public static final int CONVERSION = 1;//Value conversion
Public static final int EXTENDED = 1;//null
Public static final int MULTIANEWARRAY = 1;//Multidimensional array (size * MULTIANEWARRAY)
Public static final int LOAD = 1; / / send local variables to the top of the stack
Public static final int ARRAYLOAD = 5;//Send an item of the array to the top of the stack
Public static final int MATH = 1;//Mathematical operations and shift operations
Public static final int REFERENCE = 10;//object related operations
Public static final int NEWARRAY = 1;//One-dimensional array (size * NEWARRAY)
Public static final int STACK = 2; / / stack operation
Public static final int STORE = 1;//Save the value of the top of the stack to a local variable
Public static final int ARRAYSTORE = 5; / / store the value of the stack item into the array
Public static final int TRANSFER = 1000;//transfer transaction

```
    
* One smart contract total handling fee

    The total handling fee for a contract transaction consists of three parts
    - The first part is the transaction fee generated by the transaction size, calculated according to the byte size -> 0.001nuls/kb, which is 0.001 nuls per 1000 bytes, the transaction size is less than 1000 bytes, and the charge is 0.001 nuls.
    
    - The second part is the GAS*Price consumed by the contract execution. Price is the unit price, which means how much Na is for each Gas, Na is the smallest unit of NULS, 1Nuls is 100 million Na.
    > For example, if a contract execution consumes 20,000Gas and the set price is 30Na/Gas, then the Na consumed this time is `20000 * 30 = 600000`, which is 0.006NULS
    
    - The third part is that the GasLimit set by the caller is not consumed by the current contract execution, and the remaining Gas will be returned by the contract GAS return transaction.
    > For example, the last chestnut, the GasLimit set for the contract is 30000Gas, and the contract execution consumes 20,000Gas, then the remaining 10000Gas, the 10000Gas converted to Na is `10000 * 30 = 300000`, which is 0.003NULS, then this 0.003NULS will return the contract caller in the contract GAS return transaction of the current packaged block
    
* How much does the contract caller pay?

    In the contract transaction, the contract caller pays the first, second and third parts. In fact, the contract caller pays the first and second parts, because the third part will be returned to the contract call in the contract gas return transaction of the current packaged block. By

* Who received these fees?
    
    The block packer receives the first and second part of the fee, and the contract caller receives the third part of the fee.


## II. how to debug smart contracts

The contract SDK provides a DebugEvent. If the contract fails to execute, you can see the data of this event. Use it to debug the contract.

### 1. Debugging way

When writing a contract, use the `emit(new DebugEvent("name", "desc"))` event to send it. After the contract is released, the contract method is called. 

If the execution is successful, the debugEvent data will be displayed in the contract execution result. 

If the execution fails, the debug event data will be displayed in the returned error data.

<b style="color:red">Note: Each time you call a contract, you can display up to 10 DebugEvents, and the excess will be ignored by the Smart Contract VM. </b>

### 2. Contract code example

```java
/**
 * Example of successful call (test network)
 */
public Object clinitTest() {
    Address temp = new Address("tNULSeBaMnrs6JKrCy6TQdzYJZkMZJDng7QAsD");
    String asd = "tNULSeBaMnrs6JKrCy6TQdzYJZkMZJDng7QAsD";
    Utils.emit(new DebugEvent("clinitTest log", "asd is " + asd));
    int qwe = 123;
    Utils.emit(new DebugEvent("clinitTest log 1", "temp is " + temp));
    return temp;
}

/**
 * Example of call failure (test net)
 */
public Object clinitTestRevert() {
    Address temp = new Address("tNULSeBaMnrs6JKrCy6TQdzYJZkMZJDng7QAsD");
    String asd = "tNULSeBaMnrs6JKrCy6TQdzYJZkMZJDng7QAsD";
    Utils.emit(new DebugEvent("clinitTest log", "asd is " + asd));
    int qwe = 123;
    Utils.emit(new DebugEvent("clinitTest log 1", "temp is " + temp));
    // failed
    Utils.revert("revert");
    return temp;
}
```

### 3.  Example of execution failure
       
When the execution fails, the debugEvent data is displayed in the error message.

As in the above contract, we use `revert("revert")` in the `clinitTestRevert` method to make this call fail to execute, and return the DebugEvent event data if the simulation fails.

## III. Transaction instructions for transferring contracts to nuls assets

Ordinary account address, to the contract into the nuls, must be achieved through the `call contract' transaction

**Call contract parameter list**
 
| Parameter Name | Parameter Type | Parameter Description | Required |
| --------------- |:----------:| ---------------------------------------- |:----:|
| chainId | int | chain id | yes |
| sender | string | Transaction Creator Account Address | Yes |
| password | string | caller account password | yes |
| value | biginteger | The amount of the primary network asset that the caller transferred to the contract address. If there is no such service, fill BigInteger.ZERO | Yes |
| gasLimit | long | GAS Limit | Yes |
| price | long | GAS unit price | Yes |
| contractAddress | string | contract address | yes |
| methodName | string | contract method | yes |
| methodDesc | string | Contract method description, if the method in the contract is not overloaded, this parameter can be empty | No |
| args | object[] | List of parameters | No |
| remark | string | Transaction Notes | No|

### 1. Transfer to implementation

You can transfer the contract to NULS by filling in the corresponding amount in the `value` of the calling contract parameter.

Example of nuls-api restful request method:

```json
{
  "sender" : "tNULSeBaMvEtDfvZuukDf2mVyfGo3DdiN8KLRG",
  "gasLimit" : 20000,
  "price" : 25,
  "password" : "nuls123456",
  "remark" : null,
  "contractAddress" : "tNULSeBaMx7J2im9edmmyZofHoTWW6nCTbvy3K",
  // Fill in the NULS to be transferred here, the unit is Na
  "value" : 3600000000,
  "methodName" : "transferToContractTest",
  "methodDesc" : null,
  "args" : [ "method parameter"]
}
```
In the above example, the general account `tNULSeBaMvEtDfvZuukDf2mVyfGo3DdiN8KLRG` transferred 36 NULS to the contract address `tNULSeBaMx7J2im9edmmyZofHoTWW6nCTbvy3K`.

<b style="color:red">Note: The contract method invoked must be marked with a Payable annotation, otherwise the system will directly reject the transaction.</b>

Contract code - method implementation is as follows

```java
/**
 * Mark @Payable method to pass NULS amount when calling
 */
@Payable
public void transferToContractTest(String storedData) {
    // The NULS that the caller transferred to the contract, the unit is Na
    BigInteger value = Msg.value();
}
```

The contract uses the `Msg.value()` to get the NULS that the caller transferred to the contract. The unit is Na, as in the above code.


## IV. Contract transfers NULS out

**Transaction type txType = 18**

### 1. Transfer out implementation

In the contract SDK, there is a method in the Address object.

```java
/**
 * Contract transfers to this address
 *
 * @param value Transfer amount (how many Na)
 */
public native void transfer(BigInteger value);
```
When this method is executed within the smart contract method, the contract will transfer the corresponding asset to the specified Address, as shown in the following example:

```java
// Instantiate an Address object based on the account address
Address recipient = new Address("NULSd6HgkSpgKw3jqgbzNZ4FPodG4LEReq8cw");
// Transfer 18 nuls to this account address
recipient.transfer(BigInteger.valueOf(1800000000L));

```

### 2. Results query

If NULS is transferred from the contract address, it will be reflected in the execution result of the contract. Each contract transfer is displayed in the `transfers` array object in the result. The data displayed here is only the summary information of the contract transfer transaction.

Example: The `transfers` array object that intercepts the contract execution result is as follows

```json
"transfers": [
    {
        // Contract NULS assets are transferred out of trading hash
        "txHash": "4877f6a865dea5b4ac82a8370d73e62da15bc7acb2145a03822dddfdab329d2b",
        "from": "NULSd6Hgdf7bdag8wyRWjUuJgQ9pu46eoiV7d",
        "value": "1800000000",
        "outputs": [
            {
                "to": "NULSd6HgkSpgKw3jqgbzNZ4FPodG4LEReq8cw",
                "value": "1800000000"
            }
        ],
        / / Call the contract transaction hash
        "orginTxHash": "b5473eefecd1c70ac4276f70062a92bdbfe8f779cbe48de2d0315686cc7e6789"
    }
]
```

### 3.Complete transaction serialization data query

#### Trading background

<b style="color:red">Note: This type of transaction is not included in `block` because it is not broadcast on the node network.</b> 

Each node that receives the smart contract transaction executes the smart contract and saves the execution result on its own node. When all the contract transactions in a block are executed, a `stateRoot` will be generated. This `stateRoot` will be in the `block. `Broadcast.

#### inquiry mode

The complete transaction serialization data is also included in the contract execution result. The `contractTxList` array object in the result will contain the contract NULS asset transfer transaction generated after the execution of this contract.

The following is the result of the execution of the contract nuls asset transfer transaction

## VI. Triggering the scene of the payable method

In `vm-sdk`, there is such a description for `Contract#payable`

```java
package io.nuls.contract.sdk;

/**
 * Contract interface, contract class implements this interface
 */
public interface Contract {

    /**
     * Directly transfer to the contract, this method will be triggered, the default is to do nothing, you can override this method.
     * Prerequisite: This method needs to be overloaded and marked with the `@Payable` annotation.
     */
    default void _payable() {
    }

    /**
     * 1. This method is triggered when the consensus node reward address is the contract address. The parameter is the block reward address detail eg. [[address, amount], [address, amount], ...]
     * 2. This method is triggered when the delegate node address is a contract address. The parameter is the contract address and the bonus amount eg. [[address, amount]]
     * Prerequisite: This method needs to be overloaded and marked with the `@Payable` annotation.
     */
    default void _payable(String[][] args) {
    }
}

```

`mm-sdk``maven` depends on the following

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.nuls.sdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>sdk-contract-vm</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST</version>
</dependency>
```

### 1. the official wallet transfer function, triggered when the account address is transferred to the contract address

Trigger `payable()` no argument method

**System underlying implementation principle:**

Assembled into a call contract transaction, the default call to the contract's `_payable()` method

### 2. the consensus node reward address is the contract address, triggered when the current node is out of the block.

Trigger `_payable(String[][] args)` has a parameter method, the parameter is the current block _**all**_ reward address details eg. [[address, amount], [address, amount], ...]

**System underlying implementation principle:**

When the consensus module determines that the reward address in the CoinBase transaction has a contract address, the `_payable(String[][] args)` method of the contract is invoked, and the corresponding revenue amount is transferred to the contract address.

### 3. The entrusted address is the contract address, which is triggered when there is a current contract address in the block reward.

Trigger `_payable(String[][] args)` has a parameter method, the parameter _**is and is only**_ current contract address and bonus amount (only this one element) eg. [[address, amount]]

**System underlying implementation principle:**

When the consensus module determines that the reward address in the CoinBase transaction has a contract address, the `_payable(String[][] args)` method of the contract is invoked, and the corresponding revenue amount is transferred to the contract address.

### 4. Triggered when the user directly calls the `_payable()` method of the contract

### Note: The `_payable(String[][] args)` method is a system call method that the user cannot call.


## VII. Contract Call External Command Description

```java
public class Utils {
    /**
     * Commands that call other modules on the chain
     *
     * @param cmdName command name
     * @param args command parameter
     * @return command returns a value (depending on the return type of the registration command, it can return a string, a string array, a two-dimensional array of strings)

### 2. How to obtain contract consensus transaction data

Contract consensus transactions are not signed, and such transactions are generated when each node verifies the block. In addition, such transactions are not in the scope of broadcast data, and need to be retrieved from another interface. Please refer to the following interface for detailed data** To get the _serialized string_data of the transaction.

The following is the result of the execution of the contract internal transfer transaction.

> via `RESTFUL` interface`/api/contract/result/{hash}` 
> 
> or 
> 
> Request data via `JSONRPC` interface `getContractTxResult `: 

```json
{
"jsonrpc":"2.0",
"method":"getContractTxResult",
"params":[chainId, hash],
"id":1234
}
```
>
> Get the execution result of the contract

In the following results, `contractTxList` is the transaction generated after the execution of this contract. Note: This structure is not limited to contract consensus transactions, and different contract internal transactions will be generated according to different business, such as contract NULS asset transfer transaction-- > [Smart Contract NULS Asset Transfer Transaction Instructions](./assetsOff.html)
