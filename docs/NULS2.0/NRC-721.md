# NRC-721

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds.

## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for NFTs within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to track and transfer NFTs.

We considered use cases of NFTs being owned and transacted by individuals as well as consignment to third party brokers/wallets/auctioneers (“operators”). NFTs can represent ownership over digital or physical assets. We considered a diverse universe of assets, and we know you will dream up many more:

- Physical property — houses, unique artwork
- Virtual collectables — unique pictures of kittens, collectable cards
- “Negative value” assets — loans, burdens and other responsibilities

In general, all houses are distinct and no two kittens are alike. NFTs are distinguishable and you must track the ownership of each one separately.

## Specification

**Every NRC-721 compliant contract must implement the NRC721 and NRC165 interfaces**（(subject to “caveats” below):

     * @return `true` if the contract implements `interfaceName`, `false` otherwise
     */
    boolean supportsInterface(String interfaceName);
}
```


A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the **wallet interface** if it will accept safe transfers.

```java
package io.nuls.token.interfaces;

import io.nuls.contract.sdk.Address;

import java.math.BigInteger;


public interface INRC721TokenReceiver {

    /**
     * Handle the receipt of an NFT.
     * The NRC721 smart contract calls this function on the recipient
     *  after a `transfer`. This function MAY revert and reject the
     *  transfer.
     *  Note: the contract address is always the message sender.
     * @param operator The address which called `safeTransferFrom` function
     * @param from The address which previously owned the token
     * @param tokenId The NFT identifier which is being transferred
     * @param data Additional data with no specified format
     * @return `true` if it accepts NFTs from other contracts, otherwise `false`
     */
    boolean onNRC721Received(Address operator, Address from, BigInteger tokenId, String data);
}
```

The **metadata extension** is OPTIONAL for NRC-721 smart contracts (see “caveats”, below). This allows your smart contract to be interrogated for its name and for details about the assets which your NFTs represent.

```java
package io.nuls.token.interfaces;

import io.nuls.contract.sdk.annotation.View;

import java.math.BigInteger;


public interface INRC721Metadata {
    /**
     * @return A descriptive name for a collection of NFTs in this contract
     */
    @View
    String name() ;

    /**
     * @return An abbreviated name for NFTs in this contract
     */
    @View
    String symbol() ;

    /**
     * @return A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given asset.
     *         NULL if `tokenId` is not a valid NFT.
     */
    @View
    String tokenURI(BigInteger tokenId) ;
}
```

The **enumeration extension** is OPTIONAL for NRC-721 smart contracts (see “caveats”, below). This allows your contract to publish its full list of NFTs and make them discoverable.

```java
package io.nuls.token.interfaces;

import io.nuls.contract.sdk.Address;
import io.nuls.contract.sdk.annotation.View;

import java.math.BigInteger;


public interface INRC721Enumerable {
    /**
     * Count NFTs tracked by this contract
     * @return A count of valid NFTs tracked by this contract, where each one of
     *         them has an assigned and queryable owner
     */
    @View
    int totalSupply();

    /**
     * Enumerate valid NFTs
     * @param index A counter less than `totalSupply()`
     * @return The token identifier for the `index` NFT,
     *  (sort order not specified), NULL if `index` >= `totalSupply()`.
     */
    @View
    BigInteger tokenByIndex(int index);

    /**
     * Enumerate NFTs assigned to an owner
     * @param owner An address where we are interested in NFTs owned by them
     * @param index A counter less than `balanceOf(_owner)`
     * @return The token identifier for the `index` NFT assigned to `owner`,
     *   (sort order not specified), NULL if `index` >= `balanceOf(owner)` or invalid NFTs.
     */
    @View
    BigInteger tokenOfOwnerByIndex(Address owner, int index);
}
```

## Rationale

There are many proposed uses of Ethereum smart contracts that depend on tracking distinguishable assets. Examples of existing or planned NFTs are LAND in Decentraland, the eponymous punks in CryptoPunks, and in-game items using systems like DMarket or EnjinCoin. Future uses include tracking real-world assets, like real-estate (as envisioned by companies like Ubitquity or Propy. It is critical in each of these cases that these items are not “lumped together” as numbers in a ledger, but instead each asset must have its ownership individually and atomically tracked. Regardless of the nature of these assets, the ecosystem will be stronger if we have a standardized interface that allows for cross-functional asset management and sales platforms.


**NFT Identifiers**
Every NFT is identified by a unique `uint256` ID inside the NRC-721 smart contract. This identifying number SHALL NOT change for the life of the contract. The pair `(contract address, uint256 tokenId)` will then be a globally unique and fully-qualified identifier for a specific asset on an NULS chain. While some NRC-721 smart contracts may find it convenient to start with ID 0 and simply increment by one for each new NFT, callers SHALL NOT assume that ID numbers have any specific pattern to them, and MUST treat the ID as a “black box”. Also note that a NFTs MAY become invalid (be destroyed). Please see the enumerations functions for a supported enumeration interface.


**Transfer Mechanism**
ERC-721 standardizes a safe transfer function `safeTransferFrom` (overloaded with and without a `bytes` parameter) and an unsafe function `transferFrom`. Transfers may be initiated by:

- The owner of an NFT
- The approved address of an NFT
- An authorized operator of the current owner of an NFT
  
Additionally, an authorized operator may set the approved address for an NFT. This provides a powerful set of tools for wallet, broker and auction applications to quickly use a large number of NFTs.

**NRC-165 Interface**

We chose Standard Interface Detection (NRC-165) to expose the interfaces that a NRC-721 smart contract supports.


**Gas and Complexity**（regarding the enumeration extension）

This specification contemplates implementations that manage a few and arbitrarily large numbers of NFTs. If your application is able to grow then avoid using for/while loops in your code (see CryptoKitties bounty issue #4). These indicate your contract may be unable to scale and gas costs will rise over time without bound.

**Privacy**

Wallets/brokers/auctioneers identified in the motivation section have a strong need to identify which NFTs an owner owns.

It may be interesting to consider a use case where NFTs are not enumerable, such as a private registry of property ownership, or a partially-private registry. However, privacy cannot be attained because an attacker can simply (!) call `ownerOf` for every possible `tokenId`.

**Metadata Choices** (metadata extension)

We have required `name` and `symbol` functions in the metadata extension.
We remind implementation authors that the empty string is a valid response to name and symbol if you protest to the usage of this mechanism. We also remind everyone that any smart contract can use the same name and symbol as your contract. How a client may determine which NRC-721 smart contracts are well-known (canonical) is outside the scope of this standard.

A mechanism is provided to associate NFTs with URIs. We expect that many implementations will take advantage of this to provide metadata for each NFT. The image size recommendation is taken from Instagram, they probably know much about image usability. The URI MAY be mutable (i.e. it changes from time to time). We considered an NFT representing ownership of a house, in this case metadata about the house (image, occupants, etc.) can naturally change.


Metadata is returned as a string value. Currently this is only usable as calling from web3, not from other contracts. This is acceptable because we have not considered a use case where an on-blockchain application would query such information.

Alternatives considered: put all metadata for each asset on the blockchain (too expensive), use URL templates to query metadata parts (URL templates do not work with all URL schemes, especially P2P URLs), multiaddr network address (not mature enough)
