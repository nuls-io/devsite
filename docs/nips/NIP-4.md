## Abstract

The NULS ambassadors conduct community-building and development in various parts of the world. NULS ambassadors are divided into countries or regions, and each is limited to the selection of one NULS ambassador. 

The ambassador for each country will be chosen through competition by vote. Ambassadors will run quarterly.

The incumbent ambassadors participating in the upcoming vote, shall provide a work report from previous month, as well as a plan for the next month. The work report should include expenses for that month.

If the ambassador is a new candidate for the position, the will be required to first carry out some groundwork building their community for one month prior to the election, and then participate in the vote to become an ambassador. Participants will independently launch their candidacy on the community forum. 

Based on the number of participants, only 1/3 will get elected (e.g., if there are 10 participants, four will be elected). Also, the number of ambassadors should not exceed 1/10 of the number of nodes that have reached consensus (e.g., if there are 83 consensus nodes, there will be less than nine ambassadors). 

The voting will last for 15 days and once complete, the NULS Foundation will stake 200,000 NULS tokens into the ambassador’s node within a week’s time. The election for the ambassadors will be held in the last month of each quarter.



## Motivation

During the period between September to November 2018, we have had 9 ambassadors who have actively worked within the NULS Community to attract more members and developers. Once smart contracts are launched on the NULS main-net, there will be a community voting tool. Appointments of the ambassadors should be decided by the community. During this time, community members have given many suggestions, so we have set up some new detailed campaigning rules for the ambassadors. This will be the first step toward community autonomy, which is an important goal for NULS. It requires many fundamental tools, as well as the support from everyone in the community.



## Specification

The following is a specification of the Ambassadors participate in the election rules.





# Ambassadors participate in the election rules



## 1. Introduction of NULS Ambassadors

The NULS ambassadors conduct community-building and development in various parts of the world. NULS ambassadors are divided into countries or regions, and each is limited to the selection of one NULS ambassador. 

The ambassador for each country will be chosen through competition by vote. Ambassadors will run quarterly.

The incumbent ambassadors participating in the upcoming vote, shall provide a work report from previous month, as well as a plan for the next month. The work report should include expenses for that month.

If the ambassador is a new candidate for the position, the will be required to first carry out some groundwork building their community for one month prior to the election, and then participate in the vote to become an ambassador. Participants will independently launch their candidacy on the community forum. 

Based on the number of participants, only 1/3 will get elected (e.g., if there are 10 participants, four will be elected). Also, the number of ambassadors should not exceed 1/10 of the number of nodes that have reached consensus (e.g., if there are 83 consensus nodes, there will be less than nine ambassadors). 

The voting will last for 15 days and once complete, the NULS Foundation will stake 200,000 NULS tokens into the ambassador’s node within a week’s time. The election for the ambassadors will be held in the last month of each quarter.

 

## 2. Duties and Compensation for NULS Ambassadors

a. A candidate for the NULS ambassador is required to create a NULS node.

b. A candidate is required to agree with the values of NULS, understand the core knowledge of NULS, and respect members of the NULS community.

c. The appointment of NULS ambassadors is implemented through community voting. Candidates are able to apply for the position of ambassador during the first two months of a quarter. At the beginning of the third month of a quarter, the NULS team will initiate the voting and 1/3 of the candidates with the most votes will become the new ambassadors. For example, if 10 persons apply, 4 candidates with the most votes will get elected. 

d. Ambassadors are required to publicly display their work report summary to the whole community at the end of each month, and show the development and growth of the community as well as their plan for the next month on the forum. The work report should include expenses for that month.

e. The dismissal of an ambassador: Any node can initiate a vote to dismiss an ambassador. The vote will last for a period of 7 days. If the votes in support the dismissal exceeds 50%, then the ambassador will be dismissed. The ambassador who is dismissed cannot participate in the ambassadors’ election again for 3 months.

f. Each NULS ambassador will be entrusted with 200,000 NULS tokens from the community fund of NULS Foundation. The elected NULS ambassadors can use 80% of the consensus rewards for community building, and the remaining 20% will returned to the community fund.

g. 80% is the initial parameter fir ambassador nodes. With market fluctuations, this parameter can be modified. Any node can propose to change this parameter, with a voting period of 15 days. If the voting volume exceeds 5 million NULS tokens and the supporting votes are 70% or higher, the vote is considered passed, and the NULS Foundation will execute.

h. NULS ambassadors can apply for a budget from the NULS Foundation for major developments. The budget is open to all community members, and a budget vote will be initiated for it. The voting period is 15 days, and if the voting volume exceeds 10 million NULS tokens, and the supporting votes reach 70% or higher, the vote is considered passed and the NULS Foundation will execute.
