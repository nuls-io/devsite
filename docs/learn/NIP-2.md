NULS community members include the NULS Foundation, Council members, contributors, the open-source technology community - CODE CRAFT COUNCIL (CCC) and other all NULS Holders. 



## Motivation

In order to build a good community operation mechanism, promote community autonomy, and promote the NULS project to enable the community to evolve and drive independently.



## Specification

The following is a specification of the NULS Community Constitution.



# NULS Community Constitution

## **I. NULS Community Profile**

NULS is a blockchain infrastructure for customizable services and a global open-source community. The designed technical architecture of NULS consists of a micro-kernel and functional modules. With innovative ideas on reducing the main block chain and decoupling events and services, high modularization on underlying architecture is achieved. The NULS project, following the principles of hot plugging, modularization and parallel expansion, provides smart contracts, multi-chain mechanism and cross-chain consensus to reduce cost of development and use, and to promote the application of blockchain in the commercial field. With the proposal of basic framework containing modular thinking and multi-chain mechanism, NULS upholds the “chain” as its core development philosophy and is striving for building a core product - “Chain Factory” where users can select core function modules as they like to create their own blockchains on the NULS chain network and define their own business logic with little programming, to include smart contracts.

**NULS community is an organization of a group of people who highly assent to NULS community culture and philosophy and have the same purpose and vision to work for the development of NULS community ecology.** NULS community members include the NULS Foundation, Council members, contributors, the open-source technology community - CODE CRAFT COUNCIL (CCC) and other all NULS Holders. 



## **II. NULS Foundation**

NULS Foundation, short for the NULS FOUNDATION PTE. LTD. (201729333G), is a limited liability company incorporated in Singapore. It focuses on supporting the construction of NULS community ecology and technical research and development to promote the security, harmony and development of NULS community ecology, with the primary target of ensuring sustainable development of NULS Community ecology.

The Council members, consisting of 11 members, is formed based on a popular vote within the community. The 11 Council members, which may be changed by proposal, shall be composed of 4 technology community developers **(developer council member)** elected based on a ballot participated by all developers; and 7 members elected by ballot within the community **(standing council member)**. The top 4 in ballot within the developer community shall be elected and the remaining members shall be the first 7 in dynamic poll. Equivalently, there will be at least 4 core developers in the Council members. 



1. Application. All community members are allowed to run for a position in NULS community’s Council members. The participants only need to meet the following conditions: have at least 50,000 NULS in the application address and accept real-time supervision by the system; provide personal information, as detailed as possible and reserve at least 50,000 NULS in the application address; participants applying for developer council member shall retain at least 20,000 NULS in the application address.
2. Voting. If the application is approved, all applicants will be ranked by votes from high to low and all NULS Holders can cast a vote. The voting right shall be assigned according to the token ownership accurate to the fourth decimal place. Token and voting right shall be inseparable. Each vote is allowed to select at least 4 developers and 7 Council members.
3. Appointment. According to votes, the first 7 in the candidate list of Council members and the top 4 in the developers list shall be appointed as the Council members and the addresses of these Council members will be given the permission to put forward a proposal with respect to the system.
4. Dropping out. If the NULS holdings in candidate’s address are less than 100,000, the candidate is deemed to drop out of the campaign and all the votes will be cleared without his / her presence on the candidate list. If the candidate exits the race of his / her own accord, all his / her votes will be also cleared without his / her presence on the candidate list. After dropping out, a new application shall be made if the application address wants to run for Council member again.



### **(III) Rights and responsibilities of Council member**

## **IV. CODE CRAFT COUNCIL (CCC)**

### **(I) Introduction to the CCC**

The CCC consists of core developers from the global NULS Community and those who are interested in blockchain technology and highly agree with the NULS philosophy. They will take part in underlying architecture development of the NULS project and create the technical ecology together with the core development team.



### **(II) Philosophy of the CCC**

We stick to the following philosophy in the technology community: 

1. Equal: the technology community and core team are equal and work together for joint development.
2. Synergetic: the technology community and core team co-build the underlying architecture and create NULS ecology together.

3. Sharing: 

* The whole community shares the achievements of NULS technology.

* The whole community shares the development dividend of NULS.

* The whole community shares NULS’s influence and reputation.

* The industry shares the technical innovation brought by NULS.

* The industry shares NULS’s standard establishment to promote industry development.

4. Fair: the gains of every developer are based on his / her ability and contribution to seek for fairness and justice.

5. Innovative: strong technology community is the basic guarantee of innovative thinking of blockchain.

   

### **(III) Appointment of the CCC member**

The joining of every CCC member shall be put to vote. Before that they need to present output worthy and recognized to include a period of adaptation (1 or 2 months generally).

The process of joining CCC is:

1. Have a preliminary communication with a CCC developer to briefly introduce his / her own experience and skilled programming language.
2. Select tasks they are interested in and capable of. We will let developers join in each development taskforce to work with each other.
3. Leader of the taskforce will provide necessary documentary information to help developers start in an efficient, expedient manner. We also hope developers can maintain effective communication with one another for smooth, ease of work. About 1 month later, the developer who remains consistent with the work and produces a high-quality product, can file a node application with the technology community.
4. After intense review by the technology community and core team, the developer will be one of the CCC if the application is approved. 

### 

### **(IV) Rights and responsibilities of the CCC member**

1. NULS hopes to build a module repository covering 80% of underlying technologies in the blockchain field. We aim to lower the entry threshold of blockchain industry by increasing the modules in the repository. In doing so, the enterprises will undertake a much lower chain issuing cost and users will find it easier to use chains. We believe that only in this way can blockchain technology become a part of our daily life. 

2. The technology community will work with the core team to build a brand new architecture – NULS 2.0, which will enable NULS modules to work independently and the low-coupling module shall interact via the interface defined by standard. Then, developers (regardless of development language) can use adept programming languages as long as they comply with NULS module standard to develop the functional modules they need to enrich the module repository.

3. After that, NULS will launch Chain Factory, a chain creation tool based on the module repository. If the developer is very clear about parameters of the blockchain developed by himself / herself, like the consensus mechanism, block size and block producing time, even if he / she doesn’t have much understanding of the underlying technology, he / she can own a public chain within several minutes in 4 simple steps (of course consortium blockchain and private blockchain are available). The public blockchain development time, which is usually six months to one year, is greatly reduced.

4. Technology community will take part in all of the work mentioned above. You can bring forward any suggestions and comments to our plans regarding the technology community.

5. The CCC members, the same as the core team members, shall have the right to know, participate in, assent or object to project progress.
