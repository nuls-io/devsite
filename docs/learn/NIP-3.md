## **I. Community Fund Management**

According to the needs of the ecological development of the NULS community, the management and use of the NULS community fund is based on the principles of fairness, justice and openness. The NULS Community Fund account is open to the community and is monitored by community members. All incentive proposals are managed according to the community Charter and can be used to cover expenses. The funds will be managed by select NULS team management members of the NULS Foundation in the early stage. With the maturation and step-by-step implementation of the governance mechanism, the funds will be gradually managed by the community.

Community Fund Account Address:

[Nse9U8qaLcV7b6uFy3nr8pD3z7mKgo9u](https://nulscan.io/accountInfo?address=Nse9U8qaLcV7b6uFy3nr8pD3z7mKgo9u)

According to the guiding ideology of the community Charter, the proposal implements the operation of the Foundation account.

The proposal is initiated by the Council members: the voting period after the proposal is 15 days, the voting period for the Contributor role proposal is 7 days, and the voting support rate must reach 70%, otherwise it fails.The Council members may increase the standard of support rate according to the content of the proposal, but not less than 70%.

**Note: The Council members are appointed by the designated members of the core team. After the governance tools and community regulations are improved, the council will be elected by all community members.**

**Tentative first Council members: Liesa, Isaac, Omar, Reaper, Emerson, Penny, Berzeck, Moshe, Niels, Lin, Siwei **

## **II. The Application Member**

### **1. Ordinary Members**

All NULS Holders, community volunteers, and any other members who want to participate in the NULS community contributions. The Council members initiate the proposal for the ordinary members. The community vote for the proposal is held for 15 days.

### **2. Contributor Role**

Contributor role includes members of the CODE CRAFT COUNCIL (CCC) selected through the community's voting campaign and other members of the contributor role that will be generated through the community governance process in the future under the guidance of the community charter. **The contributor role generation process is performed in accordance with a separate proposal in the community charter, and changes to the rewards that are required by the role of the contributor still follow this process.** The Council members initiate the proposal for the contributor role members. The community vote for the proposal is held for 7 days.

## **III. The Type of Application**

### **1. Proposal to Pay Funds**

The applicant has already done something and needs to pay for some of the costs incurred by the matter. This payment applies to a one-time payment or a specific transaction. Based on NULS, a single application does not exceed 10,000 NULS.

### **2. Proposal Budget Item**

The applicant has a plan to execute and needs to initiate a proposal for a budgeted project. Proposal budget item is applicable to specific contributor roles or community members to participate in the contribution. After the proposal is passed, periodic payment will be made in installments. For example, community management, platform information maintenance, etc. The budget project is based on NULS and the maximum single-budget application does not exceed 20,000 NULS.

### **3. The Proposal to Create a Node**

Applicants can apply for a proposal to create a node through a community fund. The creation node can specify and obtain the reward address, and the funds that create the node and/or deposit requirement are still owned by the community fund. This approach is suitable for long-term cooperation such as CCC members, other capable teams, developers, or operational partners. Creation of a node deposit is equal to 20,000 NULS.  

**4. Proposal Entrusted Funds**

Applicants can apply for NULS to be entrusted to a node through a community fund. It can be a node created by the proposal, or a node created by the applicant itself. The entrusted NULS and the consensus rewards generated by the commission are owned by the community fund. This approach can be combined with a proposal creation node and is suitable for long-term cooperation to include Ambassadors, CCC members, other capable teams, developers, or operational partners, etc. The maximum amount of funds requested for application is 500,000 NULS.
