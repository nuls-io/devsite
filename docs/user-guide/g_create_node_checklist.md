# Create NULS Node Checklist

If this is your first time to create an SCO node, NULS recommends creating your node for the Testnet first.
If you are creating an POCM node, NULS insists that you create your node for the Testnet first. 

For the testnet, make sure to open the server ports 18001 and 18002.
For the Mainnet, make sure to open the server ports  8001 and 8002. 
If these ports are not open, your node will not successfully communicate with the blockchain.
# Step 0 - Test and Mainnet reference details

Testnet:
- Light wallet test environment：[https://beta.wallet.nuls.io](https://beta.wallet.nuls.io)
- Explorer test environment: [http://beta.nulscan.io/](http://beta.nulscan.io/)
- POCM test environment：[http://beta.pocm.nuls.io/](http://beta.pocm.nuls.io/)

Mainnet:
- Light wallet test environment：[https://wallet.nuls.io](https://wallet.nuls.io)
- Explorer test environment: [http://nulscan.io/](http://nulscan.io/)
- POCM test environment：[http://pocm.nuls.io/](http://pocm.nuls.io/)

Test nuls accounts are prefixed with "tNULS".
Mainnet nuls accounts are prefixed with "NULS".



## Step 1 - Setup your server 
Choose a cloud provider.  Known cloud services with a good record hosting NULS nodes are:  hetzner,  ovh, aws lightsailing. Also you can consult the Telegram channel "Nuls node owners".

Here is the configuration NULS recommends ***:  
- 16GB RAM minimum 
- 4 deadicated cores
- 200 GB hard disk

At this time, the recommended configuration will give you an "over configured" node server. "Over configured" is what you want in a node server, for the following reasons:
1. Your node server needs to have the capability to provide instant high performance when it is required to process a block.  If your node cannot provide that, your node's credit rating will drop, and yourt node will be less attractive to stakers.
2. You are not going to be monitoring your node all the time. You want your node to be able to respond to an increase in performance demand without you having to make any changes/adjustments.

We recommend Linux: CentOS 7, OpenSuse, Ubuntu, Fedora, Windows ***

## Step 2 - setup your accounts
For your node you will need 3 NULS accounts.


1. Agent account - the agent account contains the nuls required to initiate the SCO, which is 20,000 nuls. ***
2. Rewards account - the rewards account will contain the income from your node, so it is currently empty.
3. Package account -  sometimes called packer.  Every time a block is “packed” it must be signed.  The package account is used to do that. Notice the package account has a different password. When we install your SCO on the main net it will have a tough password, but for test it has a default password.


Account rules and recommendations:
1. The package account is uniquely assigned to your node.  That is, it can only be used by your node. 
2. The package account must have the password "nuls123456". (Without the quotes.)  ***
3. The password(s) for the Agent and Rewards accounts are generated by you and should be very secure.
4. Although you can use the agent and awards account for other functions, it is recommended that you dedicate those accounts to the specific node.

For test: you can issue a request including the account(s) to the URL https://nuls.community/d/131-get-the-testing-coins-of-the-testnet/464


# Step 3 -- following the instructions for the section "Create a Node"

1. For the Testnet, make sure to open the server ports 18001 and 18002.
   For the Mainnet, make sure to open the server ports  8001 and 8002. 
   If these ports are not open, your node will not successfully communicate with the blockchain.
2. For the Mainnet, follow the instructions ******

At the end of this step you will have an active consensus node on testnet or mainnet.

# Step 4 -- Assigning a name to your node

Your consensus node is assigned an eight character name.  You can search for your node using that name.

By assigning an alias for your agent address, you have assigned a name to your node. You can only assign an alias one time.
You can assign the alias using your wallet or the cli.

You can asdign an alias at any time.

# Step 5 -- Staking your node

If your objective is to create a POCM node, please proceed to the POCM checklist.  

The objective of this step is to stake your node, with increments of 20,000 NULS. Note, the minimum stake amount for a pocm is sdert my the pocm owner.
