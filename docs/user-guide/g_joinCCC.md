# Join the NULS Technical Community

## I. Introduction to NULS
NULS is a blockchain public chain project that is committed to creating a truly open-source, self-evolving blockchain platform driven by the community. NULS aims to maximize the ease of use of blockchain infrastructure by building flexible and user-friendly foundations, reducing the difficulty for enterprises/individuals to use underlying blockchain technology.

The NULS Technical Community is constructed by a group of passionate and visionary technical developers from the NULS community. The technical community collaborates with the NULS core development team to build the underlying structure of NULS. By implementing mechanisms such as modularity, multi-chain parallelism, and cross-chain support, businesses/individuals can easily customize their own blockchain through simple configurations.

In the community, we adhere to the following principles:
- Equality: The technical community and the core team have an equal relationship, collaborating on development.
- Synergy: The technical community and the core development team work together to build the technical foundation, jointly creating the NULS ecosystem.
- Sharing:
    - The community shares NULS technical achievements.
    - The community shares NULS development dividends.
    - The community shares the influence and reputation of NULS.
    - The industry shares the technological innovation brought by NULS.
    - The industry shares the standard setting for industry development driven by NULS.
- Fairness: The earnings of each developer are based on their abilities and contributions, ensuring fairness and justice.
- Innovation: A powerful technical community is the basic guarantee for sparking innovative thinking in the blockchain.

## II. Are You the One We Are Looking For?
The NULS Technical Community is open to all developers.
If you:
- Are excited about the blockchain world and want to create a new world through code.

Please join our technical community Discord: [https://discord.com/invite/aRCwbj47WN](https://discord.com/invite/aRCwbj47WN)
Note: We are not seeking outsourcing tasks. Any area you think needs improvement is a space where you can contribute.

## III. What Can We Offer?
The NULS team will reward every developer who contributes to the NULS project, and the size of the reward is based on the magnitude of the contribution. Currently, if you demonstrate outstanding performance in the early stages and join the core development team of the technical community (NTC - NULS Technical Community), the NULS Foundation will support NTC members in creating nodes to obtain consensus rewards.

## IV. Our Plans
Make chain creation easy!
Firstly, we hope to establish a module repository covering 80% of the underlying blockchain technology.
By increasing the number of modules in the repository, we will lower the entry barrier for the blockchain industry. This will result in lower costs for enterprises to launch chains, making it easier for users to use chains. We believe that only in this way can blockchain technology become more integrated into daily life.
Together with the technical community, we are building a brand new architecture - NULS 2.0. The new architecture will allow NULS modules to run independently, with low coupling between modules utilizing standard-defined interfaces. At that time, any developer (regardless of programming language) only needs to comply with the NULS module standard to develop functional modules in their preferred language, enriching the module repository.
Secondly, based on the module repository, NULS will launch a blockchain engine called ChainBox. If developers are clear about the parameters of the blockchain they are developing, such as consensus mechanisms, block size, block time, etc., even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology, they only need a few steps to have their own public chain (of course, consortium chains and private chains are also supported) in a few minutes, greatly shortening the current development time for public chains.
All of the above work will involve the participation of the technical community. If you have any opinions or suggestions about our plans, you can propose them in the technical community, showcasing your unique insights.
The NULS Technical Community currently has more than 200 developers. We welcome more developers to join us. You will be building the ecosystem together with NULS.

## V. How to Join the Development Team
1. For easy communication, please join the technical community's Discord (see above) and read relevant messages from the development group.
2. Have preliminary communication with the developer administrator, briefly introducing your experience, programming languages you are proficient in, etc. The community developers will exchange some technical-related information with you and understand what you want to do, which will determine your next work content.
