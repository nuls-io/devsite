title: How to run a client node
--------------------------

## Using Docker

The easiest way of launching a client node is using the [official docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nuls/client-node/)

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

You can run a full nuls client node with a single line:
```sh
  docker run --name nuls-node -d \
    -p 127.0.0.1:6001:6001 \
    -p 8016:8016 \
    -p 8016:8016/udp \
    -v /tmp/nuls/logs:/nuls/logs \
    -v /tmp/nuls/data:/nuls/data \
    nuls/client-node:1.0.1
```

By default the client interface is accessible in the port `6001`, so once the node is running, check that everything is working visiting the url [localhost:6001](http://localhost:6001) in your browser.

After that, try open the commands shell of the node by running:
```sh
  docker exec -it nuls-node /nuls/bin/cmd.sh

  # Then get a list of available shell commands
  >> help
```

To see the node logs run:
```sh
  docker logs -f nuls-node
```

All the data generated by the node is stored in the mounted volume `/tmp/nuls/data`.
You can read more details about how to configure the client node container [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/nuls/client-node/).

## Building it from source code

### What you will need

* JDK 1.8
* Maven 3.3+
* Git 2.x
* IDE ( Optional )

### Getting source

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nuls-io/nuls.git && cd nuls
```

### Building from source

Make sure the JDK version is 1.8

```sh
$ mvn -v
Apache Maven 3.5.4 (1edded0938998edf8bf061f1ceb3cfdeccf443fe; 2018-06-18T02:33:14+08:00)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.5.4/libexec
Java version: 1.8.0_171, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_171.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
```

If the Java version is not 1.8, it is recommended to install and set it to version 1.8.
In some linux distributions, the package `JavaFX` is not included as part of the `openjdk` package. You can get it installing the package `openjfx`:

```sh
  apt-get update && \
    apt-get -y install \
    openjfx
```

Now, we can build the node.

```
$ mvn clean package
```

After the command is successfully executed, you can find the compilation result in the path.

> client-module/client/target/nuls-node.tar.gz

### Running the node

Unpackage the binaries:
```shell
$ mvn clean package
$ cd client-module/client/target
$ mkdir nuls-node
$ tar -zxvf nuls-node.tar.gz -C nuls-node
$ cd nuls-node/bin
```

- Use `./start.sh` to run the nuls process.  
- Use `./stop.sh` to stop the nuls process.
- Use `./cmd.sh` to run the nuls shell.

## Use IDEA

Import the project folder into the IDEA and set configurations.
